# Overview

This is a proof-of-concept version of a geofence application, intended to show the principles of purely functional programming. In particular:

* It shows how to implement the domain service and data layers of the application using declarative APIs in a finally tagless style, i.e. using type classes
* It shows how to design purely functional testing catalogues (using the [puretest](https://github.com/hablapps/puretest) library), and reuse those catalogues both for unit and integration testing.
